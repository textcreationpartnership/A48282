            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap>ME CONSIDERATIONS HUMBLY PROPOSED To the worthy Members of Parliament, BY <hi>Thomas Levingſton</hi> Eſquire, and <hi>Anne</hi> his Wife, and <hi>William Powell,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Hinſon</hi> Eſquire; concerning a Petition and Complaint againſt them by <hi>John Blount,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Sterling</hi> his Wife, and Others, now under conſideration before the Honourable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee for receiving Petitions.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt, The matter in difference between the Plaintiffs, and theſe Defendants, is, only the Title unto the Eſtate lately belonging unto the Lady <hi>Powell</hi> deceaſed, the Defendant <hi>Anne's</hi> Mother's Siſter.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Complaint againſt the Defendants, is, That they did wickedly ſorce the ſaid Lady <hi>Powell,</hi> by ſeverall evill practiſes uſed upon her, to ſettle her Eſtate upon her Neece (the Defendant <hi>Anne</hi>) and did cauſe a Fine to be Antedated for the perfecting of the ſaid Settlement: And therefore the Plaintiffs deſire the ſaid Fine, and the Deſendant <hi>Anne's</hi> Deeds to be produced and vacated.</p>
            <p>Whereas the Force complained of hath been legally Examined and Tryed. For the Force complained of by the Plaintiffs is a pretended forcible Entry upon, and alſo a forcible Detainer of the Houſe of the ſaid Lady <hi>Powell,</hi> and that was legally tryed by a Jury upon the place where the force is ſuppoſed to be committed, and no Force found.</p>
            <p>And the pretended Antedating of the Writs for the Fine complained of is no more then the antient uſual Practiſe in levying Fines for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, when any ſettlement is made of any Eſtate in the vacation time. For the Writs muſt bear date in a Term, and cannot bear date in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Term, and therefore muſt bear date in a preceding Term. And in moſt of the aſſurances and ſettlements, made of any mens Eſtates in <hi>England</hi> by Fines acknowledged between the Terms, the Writs muſt bear date and be returnable the Terms foregoing ; and if thoſe be not good in Law, moſt mens Titles to their Eſtates are void : and if this were not admitted, the people could not make any perfect Conveyances and Aſſurances of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates by Fines in the vacation time.</p>
            <p>And as well the ſaid pretended ſorce and antedating of the ſaid Writs, as all other the ſuppoſed evil practiſes that the Plaintiffs could then ſuggeſd were examined before the Judges (one of which took the faid Fine in a judicial way, the ſaid Lady acknowledging to him that ſhe did the ſame freely and willingly, and without conſtraint.) And upon the Plaintiffs firſt reproachfull falſe ſuggeſtions they gave rules to stop further proceedings upon the ſaid Fine ; But upon full hearing of both Parties, with their Councell, gave their Judgment that the ſaid Fine ſhould be proceeded in, to be perfected, which was done accordingly.</p>
            <p>Therefore the ſaid Complaint againſt the Defendants is irregular ; For their Complaint ought now to be againſt that Court of Juſtice, who have examined and determined the Matters complained of, and cauſed the Settlement complained againſt to be perfected, if they have done Injuſtice therein: and the parties ought not to be further vexed or moleſted, when their Cauſe is Legally heard and Judged.</p>
            <p>But, if the ſuppoſed evill gaining a Title to the ſaid Eſtate by the Defendants be not fully examined, yet, it is both Examinable and Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the ordinary Courts of Law and Equity ; And many Settlements of ſeverall Eſtates by Fines and Deeds have been annulled and vacated upon ſufficient Proof made, that they have been unduely gained or procured by evill practices.</p>
            <p>Yet the Honourable Committee for receiving of Petitions, only upon hearing the ſaid Complaint againſt the Defendants, without their Anſwers or Defence, have required the Defendants Deeds and Evidences concerning the Defendants <hi>Annes</hi> Title to the ſaid Eſtate, to be produced, which may be of very evill conſequence, that their Adverſarie claiming the ſame Eſtate ſhould peruſe or be advertiſed of their Title before any Tryall be brought upon the ſame.</p>
            <p>The Defendants in all humility and ſubmiſſion offer it to Conſideration:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Whether the Legiſlative Power, as Legiſlative, can try the Matters in queſtion ſuggeſted againſt the Defendants.</p>
            <p>For if the Defendants have evilly and wickedly gained a pretended title to the ſaid Eſtate, they have tranſgreſſed, either the Common Law, <note place="margin">
                  <q>
                     <bibl>Rom. 4.25.</bibl> 
                     <p>where there is no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion</p>.</q> 
                  <q>
                     <bibl>Romans 3. 20.</bibl> 
                     <p>By the Law is the knowledge of Sinne</p>
                  </q>, <q>
                     <bibl>Romans 7. 7.</bibl> 
                     <p>I had not known ſinne but by the Law</p>.</q>
               </note> or the Statute Law of the Land, or elſe they have done contrary to the Rules of good conference, and equity.</p>
            <p>If either of the firſt, the Defendants puiſhment for their Offences, will be known by the Laws, they have broken ; and it is only the Juriſdictive power, as Juriſdictive, that can trie the Defendants for thoſe offences. The buſineſs being no more then the application of the Laws in being to the offences dose.</p>
            <p>It the Defendants have done the latter (that is) done contrary to a good conſcience, and equity, in gaining the ſaid Title, then that muſt be tryed by the known Rules or Equity, known and practiſed in this Nation (For there cannot be a particular Equity that concerned the Defendants onely) And that cannot be within the Limits of the Legiſlative power, as Legiſlative, When the work is onely to meaſure a Fact by the Rule already in being.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is humbly offered to be conſidered, Whether any Reaſons be offered by the Plaintiffs againſt the Defendants, why the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power ſhould in an extraordinary way, take this particular Controverse out of the hands of the ordinary Courts of Law, and Equity, whea o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the ſame nature concerning Titles unduely gained have beene, and are dayly tryed, judged, and determined by them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Whether any reaſons be offered by the Plaintiffs, why they are not relieveable by the ordinary proceedings of Law, and equity, if there be juſt cauſe for the ſame.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If the Legiſlative power ſhall pleaſe in this Caſe to exerciſe the Juriſdiſtive power(for otherwiſe they cannot take conuſance of it) <note place="margin">The wiſdom and cure of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their Late conſtitution of the Committee for Petitions, provided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſi confounding the Legiſlative pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er r, with the juriſdicttive, and limited them to neuve ſuch Petitions onely for the Parliament,, as are proper to the Legiſlative power, or not relieveable elſewhere.</note> 'tis humbly offered to be conſidered, Whether it can concern them to examine the Defendant <hi>Annes</hi> Title to the ſaid. Eſtate by the ſaid Fines and Deeds (as is now required bythe ſaid Committee) before they have tryed the Defendants for their ſuppoſed offences in the undue gaining of the laid Fine and Deeds ? For if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants be not guilty of anv ſuch offences, the Parliament cannot be ſuppoſed to intermeddle with the Defendant <hi>Annes</hi> Deeds or Title.</p>
            <p>Now the Defendants being clear in their own conſidences from any wicked practiſe, plot, or combination, wherof they are falſly &amp; malitiouſly accuſed by the means, occaſion, and procurement of one <hi>Crump,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Crompton,</hi> who was a mean menial ſervant unto the ſaid Lady <hi>Powels</hi> husband, and had endeavoured wickedly to ſeparate the ſaid Lady from her husband to her diſhonour, and who ſtriveth and hopeth to gain a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Eſtate to himſelf by ſuggeſting many falſhoods againſt us the Defendants, and inciting others upon ſuch grounds to contend for the ſaid Lady <hi>Powels</hi> real Eſtate.</p>
            <p>We the Defendants upon the Conſiderations aforegoing, humbly pray,<lb/>
               <hi>Either a diſmiſſion of the matters in queſtion, to the ordinary courſe of juſtice tried Equity. Or otherwiſe if the Parliament pleaſe to take the Tryal of them unto themſelves, That the Defendants may be firſt legally tried in firſt manner as the Parliament final direct, for the offences whereof they are aceuſed, before their Deeds, and Title to the Eſtate in queſtion be called for out of their hands.</hi>
